This is a simple python script that has to be run on your pc in the background.
There should be a bluetooth module(built-in or external) for the PC. The owner should have his bluetooth device ON(in my case it is a smart phone).
If the pc detects the owner in range it UNLOCKS the pc. If the owner goes out ofrange it LOCKS the pc for you.

Start the deamon  as:
	$ python pyBlueLock your-device-name
'your-device-name' should be replaced with your devices's name(phone's bluetooth name)

Thank You.
