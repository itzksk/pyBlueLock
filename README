This is a simple python script that has to be run on your pc in the background.
There should be a bluetooth module(built-in or external) for the PC. The owner should have his bluetooth device ON(in my case it is a smart phone).
If the pc detects the owner in range it UNLOCKS the pc. If the owner goes out ofrange it LOCKS the pc for you.
As of now the owner name is hardcoded in pyBlueLock.py
Adding another few lines would make it more generic.

Thank You.
